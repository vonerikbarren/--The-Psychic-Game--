# --The-Psychic-Game--


## Section 1 - Overview
- The Psychic Game is a simple game and was the first web application I developed. It was interesting debugging it and learning more about javascript. I hope to create more applications in the future! 


## Section 2 - Purpose
- The Purpose of the Psychic Game is to allow the user to guess a number that is randomly chosen from the English Alphabet. The user simply presses any letter and it will show what the guesses are. The additional purpose was to dip my developer toes into the murky water at the time which was javascript. 


## Section 3 - Directions

1. User goes to the website.
2. The user needs to read the very short instructions.
